sex, weight(kg), height(cm), head circumfrence, dob, date of measurement 

* boy or girl
* Get age in months

*Age in months:
1.5 = 1.0-1.99
2.5=2.0-2.99
....

*table gives you LMS from age in months
X = weight, height, head circumfrence
M = M from the table

if L != 0:
	Z = ((x/m)exp(l) - 1)/(l*s)

if L == 0:
	Z = ln(X/M)/S

Standard Normal table needed

Column that is a Z will represent the 10th place
horizontal rows on top will represent the 100th place -- may need to round
then multiply by 100 to get percentile


For all length
10, 25, 50, 75, 85th percentile 

overweight: 85th, obese: 95th
----
x-axis: date or age in months
make sure it's labeled on both axis
popover/tooltip: click on show date added and age, height and weight
* have the most recent point in graph be larger
* Make percentile lines correlate with graph
Time Period Intervals:
List all developmental milestones by category w/time periods & listed by time periods

* Change all implementations to be select sex instead of select gender

* Cross percentiles
	- Crosses 2 percentiles, banner
		- Need time frame too
	-  When above 85th percentile, banner
	- Check out intervention strategies


Meeting 01/18/19:
* Have two charts showing percentile as y-axis, and another one with weights as y-axis
* Ask Dr. Duncan: How do we want to categorize milestones in the app
* For the on coming app --  checkbox for when milestone was met
* Well Child Visit -- Dr. Shultz 
* For the Prototype:
	- milestones
	- Education
	- intervention strategies
* double checking which percentiles
* auto convert cm and in
